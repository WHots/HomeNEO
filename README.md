# Asteroid Exploration with Julia & The NASA APIs

This repository marks my initial foray into data science and the Julia programming language. Inspired by a background in low-level Windows development & reverse engineering with a fascination of space, I decided to takeup an overnight project In the area of space data science using the Julia langauge. 

# Functionality

- **API Key:** Obtain a free API key from NASA ([NASA API](https://api.nasa.gov/)).
- **Asteroid ID:** Find asteroid IDs using NASA's Small-Body Database Lookup Tool ([SBDB Lookup Tool](https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html)).

* This script collects data from NASA APIs regarding Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) with Earth as its default parameter. It displays graphs organized by date, location, distance from Earth, speed, and various units such as miles per hour (Mph), kilometers per hour (Kph), and Mach.

# Future Possibilities

This project, initially a side exploration, has sparked interest in further data science pursuits. Potential directions include:

- **AI Integration:** Developing predictive models for asteroid behavior.
- **Community Collaboration:** Inviting contributions to expand the project's scope.

## Getting Started

If you'd like to experiment with the code or contribute ideas, please feel welcome to do so. While the current focus is on functionality, the path is open for enhancements and new features.

## Project Background

This project reflects a desire to broaden my development horizons and delve into the captivating world of space data analysis.
